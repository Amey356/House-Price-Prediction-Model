House Price Prediction Model 🏡📊
Overview
This project builds a House Price Prediction Model using multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, KNN Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression. The goal is to estimate house prices based on key features and help stakeholders make informed real estate decisions.

Results
Polynomial Regression captures non-linear patterns effectively.
Regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) improve model generalization.
Tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) handle feature interactions well.
XGBoost provides the highest accuracy due to its advanced gradient boosting techniques.
